# MICB 475 Team 12: Lab Notebook and Meeting Agenda
This repository stores all the scripts and documentation related to our team's project!

## Summary
This project explores the complex effects of anemia on systemic metabolism and microbial functions, using four main metabolic indicators: Body Iron Storage, Ferritin, Retinol Binding Protein (RBP), and C Reactive Protein (CRP). These indicators provide insights into iron metabolism, vitamin A transport, protein synthesis, and metabolic syndrome.

## Project Aims
- Aim 1: Microbiome Data Processing: Use Qiime2 for initial microbiome data processing to set the stage for detailed analysis.
- Aim 2: Diversity Analysis: Examine microbial diversity using Qiime or R to identify significant differences related to anemia.
- Aim 3: Targeted Analysis: Focus on interesting findings from the diversity analysis for deeper investigation, potentially expanding to differential abundance analysis.
- Aim 4: Metabolic Pathway Analysis: Use PICRUSt2 for functional analysis to identify metabolic pathways affected by anemia, using server-based and R analyses.
- Aim 5: Development of Predictive Models: Use identified metabolic markers to develop models predicting anemia
